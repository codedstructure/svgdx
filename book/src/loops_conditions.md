# Delta 7 - Loops and Conditions

> `svgdx` allows elements to be included multiple times based on conditions

## Conditions

All conditions in `svgdx` boil down to a single check: is the value of a conditional expression *zero* (false) or *non-zero* (true).

The simplest use of a condition is the `<if>` element. This has a single mandatory attribute '`test`', which is evaluated as an expression.
